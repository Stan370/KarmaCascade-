## 🕹️ What is HungryMod Karma?

**HungryMod Karma** puts you in the shoes of a power-hungry Reddit moderator. Comments are flooding in faster than you can read them. Approve the good ones, delete the trolls, and keep your subreddit tidy! But beware: with great power comes great responsibility... or absolute corruption.

> "It began as a hobby. Cleaning up spam. Banning bots. Keeping the subreddit tidy. But over time... it changed. The karma. The power. The little red buttons. They whispered: 'Ban them.' Now you feed on control, eyes glowing with automod regex. Every comment a threat. Every post... a test. This isn't moderation anymore. This is a purge."
